**Language, Optimized.**
A language engineered for the modern mind. Built on logic, optimized for clarity, and sourced from the world.

## 📜 The Mission

Natural languages are historical accidents. They are filled with redundancy, ambiguity, and irregular rules that waste human processing power. English requires 10 years of schooling to master, yet even native speakers make mistakes daily. It is spaghetti code for the mind.

**Opmun** is an engineering initiative to build the world's first truly logical, unbiased, and community-sourced language.

### The Philosophy: `Op` + `Mun`

* **`Op` [Optimal / Open]:** We apply pure logic to communication. We strip away redundancy to find the single most efficient way to express an idea. We operate through open, democratic debate.
* **`Mun` [World / Community]:** Derived from *Mundus* and *Communis*. We source vocabulary from Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, and English to create a neutral standard for everyone.

## ⚖️ The Core Charter

To ensure Opmun remains optimal, we are governed by immutable logical laws:

1.  **Logic First (Zero Irregulars):** If you know the rule, there are no exceptions. No memorization required.
2.  **Efficiency (Shortest-Form Priority):** We optimize for bandwidth. High-frequency words (e.g., "I", "Go") get the shortest sounds.
3.  **Phonetic Consistency:** One Letter = One Sound. No silent letters. If you can hear it, you can spell it.
4.  **Global Sourcing:** Logic wins, not bias. We choose the word that is shortest and most distinct, regardless of its origin.
